# Boot.Dev

As an aspiring developer, I have found [Boot.Dev](https://www.boot.dev/) to be an invaluable online resource. The platform provides a structured learning path for back-end development, removing the mystery of what to learn first and next. The site makes learning enjoyable and rewarding with hands-on coding exercises and guided projects in various programming languages. Each folder in this repository represents a different learning module from the Boot.Dev curriculum. Inside each section, you will find solutions to questions that are similar to, but not exactly the same as, those in the curriculum to avoid copyright issues. Additionally, I solved questions I created to reinforce my own learning.
