# Python Functional Programming

This learning module from [Boot.Dev](https://www.boot.dev/), along with my personal studies, covers the following topics:

* __Core concepts:__ immutability, sum types, pure functions, first-class functions, higher-order functions, recursion, function transformations, decorators, currying, closures, memoization
* __Techniques:__ map(), filter(), reduce()

## Personal Additions

In addition to completing the required modules from Boot.Dev, I created my own questions that combined concepts from multiple lessons. This approach helped me reinforce my knowledge and improve my problem-solving abilities. You can find the filenames of the questions I created below, with each one including unit tests in this repository for review.

* __sum_chars_by_doc_word_length.py :__ The program accepts as input a string. The methods map(), filter(), and reduce() are used to process the document. The program returns an integer for a character count that meets a certain criteria.

* __check_nba_season_information.py :__ The program applies the concepts of sum types (enums), function transformations, and closures. If decorators had been used, then lines 94 and 95 would have been unnecessary. The program processes end-of-season NBA standings, providing information about team rankings, home court advantage, and playoff opponents.
