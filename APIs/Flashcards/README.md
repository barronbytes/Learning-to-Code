# Flashcards API

This mini-project allowed me to create a RESTful API prototype for study flashcards. It lays the groundwork for a larger capstone project aimed at enhancing math classrooms. The goal will be to allow teachers to input algorithms for questions to generate unique, randomized question-answer pairs. That way, each student is assigned different questions based upon the same algorithm, promoting academic integrity.

# Prerequisites

Before running this project locally, ensure you ahve the following installed:

* IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
* Instally Python 3.10+ version > for type hinting compatability
* Install **pydantic** from terminal: `pip install pydantic`
* Install **FastAPI** from terminal: `pip install fastapi`
* Install **ASGI server** (e.g., **uvicorn**): `pip install uvicorn`
