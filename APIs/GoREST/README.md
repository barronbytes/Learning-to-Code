# Requests Module with GoREST API

This mini-project allowed me to practice using Pythonâ€™s `requests` module to perform basic CRUD operations on a RESTful API.

* The open-source [GoREST API](https://gorest.co.in/) was used to interact with data.
* API endpoints were explored and tested with [postman](https://www.postman.com/) before implementing code.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project locally, ensure you have the following installed:

* IDE (VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)
* Install Python 3.10+ version > for type hinting compatability
* Install requests module: `python3 -m pip install requests`

# Requests Module: CRUD Operations

**Create** data with the `get` method:

```python
    r = requests.get(url)
    data = r.json()
```

**Update** data with the `put` method:

```python
    r = requests.put(url=request_url, headers=headers, data=payload)
```
