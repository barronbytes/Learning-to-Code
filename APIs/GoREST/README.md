# Requests Module with GoREST API

This mini-project allowed me to practice using Pythonâ€™s `requests` module to perform basic CRUD operations on a RESTful API.

* The open-source [GoREST API](https://gorest.co.in/) was used to interact with data.
* API endpoints were explored and tested with [postman](https://www.postman.com/) before implementing code.
