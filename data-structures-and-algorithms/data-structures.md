# Data Structures

Learning data structures is *super* hard! Building them from scratch turned out to be a great way to learn. I coded some on my own and leaned on AI for othersâ€”I'm looking at you, [Red-Black Tree](https://github.com/barronbytes/learning-to-code/blob/main/data-structures-and-algorithms/data-structures/my_red_black_tree.py)! ðŸ˜… These guiding questions helped me think through each one:

1. What is this data structure meant to do?
2. What are important rules and methods?
3. What edge cases should I consider?
